### MUSA 508 - Public Policy Analysis Assignments
Instructor: Dr. Michael Fichman and Matt Harris  <br>
Course Description: This course teaches advanced spatial analysis and an introduction to data science/machine learning in the urban planning and public policy realm. The class focuses on real-world spatial analysis applications and, in combination with introductory machine learning, provides students a modern framework for efficiently allocate limited resources across space. We will learn novel approaches for ensuring our models do not discriminate against communities/people of color as well as communities of different income levels.

### STATS 701 - Modern Data Mining
Instructor: Dr. Linda Zhao <br> 
Statistics has been evolving rapidly in the era of big data and provides tools to harvest knowledge
from big data. Focusing on methodologies with reasoning, the class brings in a large set of cutting
edge machine learning techniques with applications. Hands-on data experience with R throughout
the semester is another feature. The class will begin with data acquisition and exploratory data
analysis (EDA) along with tools for reproducible report, an essential part of data science. We next
show how to build, interpret, and adopt basic models; then go beyond to contemporary methods
and techniques for handling large and complex data with applications in finance, marketing,
medical fields, social science, entertainment, you name it. While this course extensively uses the
statistical programming language R, no programming experience is required. By the end of the
semester, students will master popular modern statistical methods but also get equipped with
hands-on skills in handling data of essentially any size.
